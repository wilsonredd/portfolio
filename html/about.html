                        <h2>About</h2>

                        <p>I am currently a computer science student at Brigham Young
                            University. For the past two years, I have worked as a
                            research assistant at the Perception, Cognition, and Control
                            Lab, a deep learning research lab, on BYU's campus.</p>

                        <p>My research project is focused on applying deep learning
                            to cancer diagnosis. Our goal is to increase the breadth and
                            quality of cancer screenings in rural areas of India.
                            Currently, we are researching self-supervision pretraining
                            techniques. In January 2018, I was able to travel to India to
                            understand how our research would viable function in that
                            environment. I alsp attended NeurIPS 2019 in Vancouver,
                            Canada to deepen my knowledge of current state of the art deep
                            learning research.</p>

                        <p>I am also currently working on a capstone team in partnership
                            with Adobe. We are creating a solution to enable more efficent
                            monitoring of their internal data streams, such as data center
                            memory and latency. The project is focused on multi-variant
                            time series anomaly detection.</p>

                        <p>Throughout my undergraduate experience, I have been able to
                            work on a variety of projects ranging from a Ticket to Ride
                            Android app, to multiple deep learning projects, to most
                            recently front-end and back-end web development.</p>

                        <p>Last summer, I worked as a Software Development Engineer Intern at
                            Amazon Web Services in Seattle, Washington. My projected sped up
                            their account event publishing rate by 90%.</p>

                        <p>I was the team volunteer manager on the BYU Supermileage vehicle
                            team where we placed 1st against over 100 collegiate teams at the
                            2018 Shell Eco-marathon Americas at Sonoma Raceway, CA.</p>
